# python-navegador
A stack exercise for my university, with OOP.
Tab Navigator: The system simulates a simple web browser, allowing the user to navigate forward and backward between pages.
It uses stacks (LIFO) to manage the browsing history, with push and pop operations to simulate the actions of going back and forward between pages,
enabling the user to efficiently track their navigation history.
